## SNAKE!

This game was made in my CS5410 Game Development class. Thanks to my professor Dr. Dean Mathias.

I actually made this game for a midterm test where we had no idea beforehand what the game we would have to make would be. We were allowed to bring in some framework code that we had written. Some of the code is a bit messy because I wrote it in 3 hours and just whipped out what worked. I should probably clean it up but it is still fun to play! I put this up for HackUSU community night.
